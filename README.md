## Abstract

Kleptoparasites do not directly parasitize their hosts butinstead steal food and resources, reducing host fitness. Like direct parasites,kleptoparasites can be highly dependent on their hosts such that theirevolutionary histories may be linked. Here, we study the evolution of akleptoparasitic wasp genus, *Synergus* (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae: Synergini), inrelation to their hosts, oak gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae: Cynipini).Ovipositing oak gall wasps induce the formation of galls on oaks (Fagaceae)that provide food and shelter to one or more developing gall wasps. Gallsinduced by different gall wasp species are diverse in size, shape, color, andlocation on the host tree, and tend to be specific to just one or a few oaktree species. *Synergus*, and other kleptoparasites, exploit galls byovipositing into the developing gall and inducing the development of asecondary gall chamber. *Synergus* larva feed on the gall tissue, sometimesreducing food available to the oak gall wasp larva to the extent that the hostdies. We ask how the ecology of gall wasps has affected the diversification of*Synergus*. We compare the topologies of *Synergus* and gall wasp phylogenetictrees and detect a significant signal of cophylogeny, or congruence of theevolutionary relationships, that appears limited to only a few interactions. Weuse traits of oak galls to describe the ecological niche for each *Synergus*species and reconstruct ecological traits of ancestral nodes and find that*Synergus* kleptoparasites are evolving both under cospeciation and hostswapping scenarios.

## Introduction

Several insect orders have evolved an ability to inducegalls - non-usual growths of plant tissue that provide nutrition and defensesto the progeny of the gall-forming insect. Despite the defenses provided bygalls, most gall-forming insect species are attacked by specialized parasitesthat evade those defenses and kill the young insect. A galling insect and itsparasites are thus partnered in an ecological and evolutionary dance: changesto a gall’s defenses that result in enhanced evasion of parasites may improvegallformer fitness, while a parasite’s fitness might improve via changes in theways it overcomes those defenses. There are a variety of possible long-termoutcomes of such interactions. This includes scenarios such as cospeciation,where both partners coevolve and ultimately codiversify in concert with oneanother, or host swapping, wherein parasites evolve adaptations to attack hostswith different traits than those parasitized by ancestral taxa. Gallformersmight also escape their ancestral parasites by undergoing dramatic evolutionarychanges in gall structure, location, or phenology.

However, considering only the evolutionary interactionsbetween single pairs of gallformer and parasite species wildly simplifies thetypical gall’s ecological landscape. Most gall-forming insects are attacked bynot one but a diverse community of parasitic species. Those same gall-formersalso often live in sympatry with myriad other gall-forming insect species, eachassociated with their own parasite community. Thus, as a gall-former’s defensesevolve, it might partially or entirely evade attack from one parasite butbecome more vulnerable to attack by another parasitic species already exaptedto the new defenses: perhaps a congener of the ancestral parasite, perhaps aparasite from another genus entirely. Similarly, a parasite’s trait evolution,in response to changes in its host gall, might also make that parasite betterable to attack new gall types. If parasite host shifts and host rangeexpansions are sufficiently common, host and parasite phylogenies may not betightly linked, with clades of parasites being united more by shared galltraits than by host phylogeny. Further, different genera of parasitesinteracting with the same communities of gallformers might show similarhistories, complementary histories, or some mixture of the two.

Oak gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) that induce galls onoak trees present an excellent system for studying the intertwined evolutionaryhistories of gallformers and their natural enemies. In the Nearctic, >700species of oak gall wasp induce galls on oak species. Most oak gall waspspecies have a sexual and an asexual generation, each of which induces a gallof a specific type on a specific organ of a specific oak species. The gallsthemselves, already variable in their tree host and location on those trees,also vary greatly in morphology and other potential defensive traits. Somegalls are smooth, others may have a light pubescence, long hair, or even longspines. Some produce nectar, shown to both trap parasites and attractbeneficial predators. Some have larval cells protected by bark, while forothers the cells are suspended by fibers or are free rolling in hollowchambers, which may make it more challenging for parasites to oviposit.Phenology, including both the time of year that the gall is present and the incubationtime of the larval gall wasp, also varies greatly and may restrict attack bycertain parasites. Non-visible traits such as titers of chemical defenses, mayvary too, but such variation has only rarely been compared across gall types. Asingle oak tree species can host to many co-occurring galls induced bydifferent wasp species and oak species in many parts of the Nearctic arebroadly sympatric, such that many “types” of different oak galls often occupy asingle landscape.

Community diversity studies documenting all the naturalenemies from any single species of Nearctic oak gall wasp are rare, but whenthey have been performed it is typical that ten or more different species ofparasite, kleptoparasite, and/or hyperparasite are recorded from a gall type(e.g., Joseph *et al.* 2011, Bird *et al.* 2013; Forbes *et al.* 2016,Weinersmith *et al.* 2020). Among the known Nearctic oak gall associates, atleast 11 insect genera (*Allohorgas, Brasema, Ceroptres, Euceroptres, Euderus,Eupelmus, Eurytoma, Ormyrus, Sycophila, Synergus, Torymus*) each have severaldifferent species associated with one or more galls (Ward *et al.* 2022b),suggesting each genus has a long-standing evolutionary relationship with oakgalls. These 11 genera present opportunities to test whether galler-parasiteevolutionary histories are more often defined by cospeciation or by shiftingpatterns of host-parasite relationships, as well as whether different naturalenemies share similar histories.

Here, we attempt to disentangle the evolutionary history ofone genus of natural enemies that are part of a single guild of oak gallassociates: the kleptoparasitic cynipoid wasps. Often described as inquilines,wasps in the genera *Synergus* (Cynipidae) feed primarily on the tissue oftheir host gall and not on the gallformer. Their presence sometimes results inthe death of the gall wasp and sometimes does not, but in either case theirco-option of the gall wasp’s resource makes them more parasitic than strictlyinquilinous. *Synergus* wasps form secondary chambers in the host gall. Thisgenus is one of the most common kleptoparasites associated with Nearctic oakgall wasps and thus studying how the genus evolved alongside their gall wasphosts allows for a deeper understanding of the evolutionary concert betweenhosts and parasites.

We have previously reared wasps of this genus from aphylogenetically diverse set of Nearctic oak galls (Ward *et al.* 2022b). Manyhave been previously separated into putative species using mitochondrialsequence variation, morphology, and ecology (Ward *et al.* 2020), but nomulti-gene phylogeny of *Synergus* exists. We here infer phylogenies anddelimit putative species for samples across the genus, and then use host gallecology and the existing phylogeny of Nearctic oak gall wasps (Ward *et al.*2020) to as two overarching questions. First, is there a co-phylogenetic signalbetween *Synergus* kleptoparasites and their gallformer hosts, and, if so, doesthis appear to reflect cospeciation or have some other potential cause? Second,has the use of galls with different traits evolved over time and have galltraits potentially affected kleptoparasite evolution?

## Materials and Methods

**Data Acquisition**

The phylogenetic trees used in this analysis were createdfrom concatenated data sets of ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) and cytochromeoxidase subunit 1 (CO1). Our approach to delimiting putative species relied onintegration of UCE, COI, ecological, and morphological data. Putative speciesassignments had previously been made based on a combination of mitochondrialCOI sequence data, morphology, and ecology (Ward *et al.* 2020). We did notseek to repeat previous COI work here, but rather to build upon it with new UCEsequence data. We used a quartet frequencies-based species delimitation method(SODA; Rabiee and Mirarab 2021) to estimate species from the UCE data.Individual gene trees were generated using the best models selected fromModelfinder using IQ-TREE, and SODA was performed without using a guide tree.We compared SODA results with ASAP results, and, in instances where theydisagreed, used collection information, ecology, and morphology to decide onputative species assignments.

Assignments of ecological interactions were decided based onrearing data. All samples used to construct the phylogeny of *Synergus* werecollected by the Forbes Laboratory at the University of Iowa. Thus, all sampleswere reared from oak galls collected by the laboratory. A working document waskept during time of rearing collections and associations between *Synergus* andCynipini were based on whether a *Synergus* kleptoparasite was found emergingfrom a given gall species. Statistical analysis of these associations wascompleted in R version 4.2.2 along with all figure creation.

**Procrustean Approach to Cophylogeny (PACo)**The first partof this analysis uses a "procrustean approach to cophylogeny" (PACo;Balbuena *et al.*, 2013; Hutchinson *et al.*, 2017). This analysis takes the topologyof two phylogenetic trees, usually a host and a parasite, and compares theshapes in a graphical plane. This involves shifting coordinates, or values,that define the shapes and superimposing them onto another (also known asprocrustean superimposition). So, it does not matter if the values thatgraphically define one shape are smaller than another, each is shifted inproportionally so that both shapes can be compared in the same virtual space.Once superimposed, a value of the similarity can be extracted. In PACo, this isthe value of cophylogeny that describes whether there is congruence between theshape of two phylogenetic trees. This can be further assessed by completing aParaFit analysis which provides a value of coevolution for associations, orecological interactions between the two phylogenies (Legendre *et al.*, 2002).

To perform PACo analysis of cophylogeny, we will first beginby accessing the data in R. Next, we plot the phylogenies for *Synergus* andCynipini in a cophyloplot and use data from an association matrix to draw linesof association. Lastly, we will use the quantitative values of the branchesfrom both phylogenies to create a matrix of patristic distances or sums of thebranch lengths that link nodes.

Once all three of these matrices have been created, we cancomplete the PACo analysis of cophylogeny set to 10,000 permutations. Since weare forcing a shape change between two objects, one object may be shifting in anegative direction which will result in a negative eigenvalue, or scalar factorof transformation. Negative eigenvalues cannot be read when performing theParaFit analysis of coevolution as they do not represent 'real space' so mustcorrect them. To do this, we completed a manual correction using square roots,the "Cailliez" correction, and the "Lingoes" correction(Hutchinson *et al.*, 2017). We chose the most conservative correction fromthese three to interpret. We extracted values of the residuals from theanalysis and plotted them on a bar graph while drawing the line of best fit asa flat linear value going through the middle of the plot.

**Ancestral State Reconstructions**The second part of thisanalysis attempts to visualize how physical traits or characteristics of oakgall wasps might constrain or affect evolution of *Synergus* kleptoparasites.This involves associating a particular trait of an oak gall wasp to itscorresponding *Synergus* taxa. For example, we can associate the location anoak gall wasp forms galls on an oak tree (i.e., leaf, stem, bud, or fruit) tothe corresponding *Synergus* that parasitizes that oak gall wasp. Aftercompleting this for each *Synergus* species, we can perform tests that attemptto simulate how these traits may have arisen at terminal nodes of thephylogeny. These tests utilize models to describe how traits evolve. Forexample, the "equal rates" (ER) model simulates evolution of thetraits using the assumption that the likelihood of changing from one trait toanother is uniform for all variations of that trait. Other models exist such asthe "all-rates different" (ARD) model where each variation of a traithas a unique probability of being gained or lost evolutionarily. Each model hasa corresponding AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) value that determines how closeof a fit it is to the expected result at the terminal nodes, or how likely itis to be accurate in predicting them. We performed multiple tests for eachtrait and chose the model with the lowest AIC value to ensure statisticalaccuracy. This resulted in the ER models being the most highly supported forancestral state reconstruction for each trait tested. We completed this fortraits such as gall size, presence of spines on the gall, texture, hairiness,nectar production, presence of fibers inside, location of the gall on the oak,phenology, and oak species.

**PACo and Cophylogeny:**PACo analysis of Synergus and theirgall wasp phylogenies rejected the hypothesis that associations between treesare random (10K permutation, m<sup>2</sup><sub>xy</sub>= 0.0259, *p* < 0.00001). However, bar plots of squared residuals from PACo(Fig. 1B) show associations that were significant from the ParaFit analysis(marked with an asterisk) which indicate host-parasite coevolution occurringprimarily in associations of *Synergus* kleptoparasites and gall wasps in thegenus *Philonix*. These associations are marked with a red line in Fig. 1A. Noother associations were marked as significant in the ParaFit analysis whichsuggests that the association between *Synergus* and *Philonix* are biasing theanalysis in one direction. We then performed the ParaFit analysis using threedifferent corrections for negative eigenvalues produced from the Procrustessuperimposition: Cailliez, Lingoes, and a manual square-root correction(Cailliez, 1983; Lingoes, 1971; Hutchinson et al., 2017). From these, we chosethe most conservative correction to interpret. This generated a ParaFitstatistic equal to 0.0254 with a permutational *p* = 0.458 at 10k permutations.These results indicate that the similarity of diversification between Synergusand Cynipidae cannot be attributed to random chance and suggests congruencewith a coevolutionary history.

**Discrete Trait Analysis and Ancestral StateReconstruction:**The results from our PACo and ParaFit analysis suggest thatmany of the associations between kleptoparasites and their hosts cannot beattributed cophylogentic congruence nor do they fit the statistical models ofcoevolution. To better understand this, we chose to model traits ofkleptoparasite hosts to the *Synergus* phylogeny. This will allow visualizationof *Synergus* evolving to parasitize hosts either under expectations ofcospeciation or host switching. We modeled twelve traits of Cynipini to the*Synergus* phylogeny and observed a combination of cospeciation and hostswapping scenarios. Occasionally, both were present in the same phylogeny (Fig.1D). However, the primary result from these reconstructions is best fit by ahost swapping scenario (Figs. 1C & 1D). In these reconstructions, we aredefining cospeciation events as tightly conjoined evolutionary events thatmanifest as individual clades in the phylogeny. For example, Fig. 1D shows areconstruction of oak section on the *Synergus* phylogeny. On the leftmost sideof the tree, we can visualize a complete clade forming with high support forthe likelihood that the most recent common ancestor having the trait present atthe terminal nodes of *S. coniferae*, *Synergus nr. lignicola*, and *S.lignicola*. Likewise, this phylogenetic tree and those seen in Figs.1C & 1Ealso show other scenarios separate from our defined coevolution. Thesepatterns, wherein the ability to parasitize galls with a particular traitevolves at multiple points in the phylogeny, we refer to as host swapping.These patterns can be described under the host swapping hypothesis wherein*Synergus* kleptoparasites evolve towards traits suddenly, at least in thescaling of geologic time.

## Discussion

Our results provide insight that some associations betweenhosts and parasites fit the conceptual idea of close evolutionary choreography.However, this analysis only attempts to study one particular genus of kleptoparasitesand ignores additional interactions in separate systems. Our findings that someassociations can be statistically represented as coevolution raises questionson how these computational procedures can be applied to additional genera ofgall wasp kleptoparasites or even additional systems with close host-parasiteassociations. Moreover, our findings that *Synergus* kleptoparasites do notdirectly fit either model of trait evolution we can conclude that some traitsappear more accurate to one description. This may suggest that traits arequickly being evolved by positive selection since oak gall are so regularlyinvaded by a diverse community of insects other than this one genus ofkleptoparasites.

To fully develop a complete understanding of how kleptoparasitesevolve in relation to their hosts, we intend to extend this analysis to othergenera of kleptoparasites that are closely associated with oak galls. Theseinclude the genera *Ceroptres* and *Euceroptres*. Our laboratory has reared aconsiderable amount of both genera from oak galls. UCE data is alreadyavailable for *Ceroptres* kleptoparasites but has not been completed for*Euceroptres* or other genera of kleptoparasites. Additionally, our analysisonly begins to formulate a complete picture of how ecological space may alterdiversification of kleptoparasites. To understand how these organisms mayinteract with each other, one of our following steps will be to characterizeecological traits and model them as principal component analyses. Theoretically,this should allow us to determine whether genera are saturating a specificecological trait of galls and may explain why there is not widespreaddiversification towards particular traits in the case of *Synergus*.

## Reflection

Throughout this project, I encountered many issues that hadthe ability to hinder reproducibility. The first of these stems from being aWindows user. While the University of Iowa has access to a robust highprocessing cluster and remote Linux systems for students, I wanted to find away to complete this in an operating system that is likely more familiar toothers. So, I decided to use the Widows subsystem for Linux (wsl). My personal approachwas to use Ubuntu through a ‘wsl’ command in Powershell. Of course, settingthis up and writing script to mount drives I might be accessing posed ahindrance on initial work efficiency. However, because I was still accessing atype of Linux kernel the actual analysis downstream became much more accessibleto others. Anyone with any machine should be able to run the code I havewritten if they either have a Linux (or pseudo-Linux machine such as a Mac) or canaccess wsl. Additionally, the flexibility of having a Linux command line soreadily accessible has provided robustness to my overall workflow and madeseveral tasks considerably time efficient.

Once I established a working system and provided some generalorganization architecture, the remainder of the process was relativelystraightforward. Of course, there will always be troubleshooting but I try toexpect it and even welcome it in my general daily workflow. However, providingorganization for folders and files meant that automation of several parts of thepipeline were not only possible but very feasible. This minimized much of theinitial troubleshooting and allowed me to begin performing analysis quickly. Ifeel that this was even more imperative since github was a requirement for thisproject. But automating several aspects of my work with the help of a goodorganization system, I found that there was more time than I may usually haveto learn a new tool such as git.

Yet, even with a good system for structuring my work, therewere still problems with how I communicated it. All too often do I find myselfworking for days or weeks without holding a conversation on what I am doing.Without a stream of communication, it is far too easy to forget how to bestcommunicate my work. When explaining this to classmates, I often found theywere at a loss. Not only did the analysis sound foreign, but the biologicalideas did also as well. So, I continued refining not only my writing but myverbal explanations and even my code annotations. Really, it was just about howto tell the story and the code was the fan fiction. I just needed to provide anarrative that anyone could grasp. The work that scientists do may not be comparablein a natural sense but the flow of information and the way in which a story istold holds true regardless of the system. So, I took this into my submissionand constantly refined how I provided that story. On that note, it was both funand rewarding receiving peer-feedback and not only seeing classmates understandwhat I had done but provide some intriguing questions and suggestions.

Finally, I just want to add that this was a wonderful course.I walk away feeling like a more polished data scientist. Thank you Bin and Yannfor providing such an enjoyable and educational challenge.
