## Supplementary Materials
This supplement is meant to provide higher resolution images from the main figure. Since Figure 1 is a portable network graphic (png), there is a loss in the resolution. To assist any readers, a scalable vector graphic (svg) has also been created for each panel of Figure 1. These exist for all images created throughout this analysis. Please see the final images portion of the "github" repository for additional images.

Figure S1. Tanglegram of the cophylogeny between Cynipini (gallformers) and *Synergus*. Red lines indicate significant relationships defined under coevolution statistical models from the ParaFit statistic.

Figure S2. Barplot of plotted residuals. This is the output of PACo. The red asterisks show relationships that are significant from ParaFit. The line through the middle of the plot is defined as the median squared residual.

Figure S3. Ancestral state reconstruction of *Synergus* kleptoparasites and traits of the Cynipini they parasitize. This phylogeny shows the trait of light hairiness.

Figure S4. Ancestral state reconstruction of *Synergus* kleptoparasites and traits of the Cynipini they parasitize. This phylogeny shows taxonomic section of the oak trees associated with the Cynipini that is associated with the mapped *Synergus* taxa. This shows the host of the host for the kleptoparasite genus.

Figure S5. Ancestral state reconstruction of *Synergus* kleptoparasites and traits of the Cynipini they parasitize. This phylogeny shows the trait of spines on a gall.
