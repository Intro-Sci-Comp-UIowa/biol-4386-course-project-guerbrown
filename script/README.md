### This contains all functioning scripts used in the analysis. Currently, all analysis is being completed in this folder but fucntioning scripts will be left here and the actual analysis will be moved to the /analysis folder.

##### Code for each analysis has been seperated into PACO_Scripts and TraitModeling_Script

##### The purpose of this is to ease viewing for anyone trying to reproduce this code. 
##### If you are attempting to view this code to recreate any figures, please see the individual README.md files in the corresponding folder for further information.
##### In the event there are any difficulties with script, please use the .RDATA and .Rhistory files. If these are not sufficient, please see use the commits and track down any particular difficulties using the changes I have made to any errors in the script or data managment of this project.
