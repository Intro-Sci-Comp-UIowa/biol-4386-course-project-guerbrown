# This directory houses all data used for the analysis.

### Descriptions of the files:
1. PACo
- inqcophy_PACo_AssociationMatrix_guerbrown_guerbrown_v04_15Feb2023:
	- This is the assocation data that is used to compute the PACo analysis of Synergus inquilines
- inqcophy_PACo_CynipidTree_guerbrown.nex 
	- This is the tree of Cynipini. It is used in both the PACo and Traitmodeling analysis 
- inqcophy_PACo_UCECO1SynTree_guerbrown.nex
	- This is the tree for *Synergus* kleptoparasites. It is different from the tree in the trait modeling file. This is due to slight alterations and pruning due to constraints on the associations with Cynipini
2. Trait Modeling
- inqcophy_traitmodeling_SynTree_guerbrown.nex:
	- This is the phylogenetic tree for *Synergus*. It is constructed using a mixture of CO1 and UCE data (see Forbes et al., manuscript in preperation) 
- inqcophy_traitmodeling_TraitData_guerbrown.csv:
	- This is the data for ecological traits of Cynipini listed with the correspoding *Synergus* kleptoparasite
